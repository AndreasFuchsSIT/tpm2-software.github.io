## CONTIBUTING

All changes should be introduced via github pull requests. This allows anyone to
comment and provide feedback in lieu of having a mailing list. For pull requests
opened by non-maintainers, any maintainer may review and merge that pull
request. For maintainers, they either must have their pull request reviewed by
another maintainer if possible, or leave the PR open for at least 24 hours, we
consider this the window for comments.

- All commits should adhere to the git commit message guidelines described here:
  https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ with the following exceptions.
- We allow commit subject lines up to 80 characters.
- All contributions must adhere to the Developers Certificate of Origin. The
  full text of the DCO is here: https://developercertificate.org/. Contributors
  must add a 'Signed-off-by' line to their commits. This indicates the
  submitters acceptance of the DCO.
- Changes must be merged with the "rebase" option on github to avoid merge
  commits. This provides for a clear linear history.
